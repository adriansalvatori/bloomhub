## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Lightning-fast HMR builder. 
- **React**: The front-end framework used for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Standard for React Navigation. 
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Leveraging the `@mui/base` variant for design consistency.
- **CSS and Sass**: Utilized for creating structured and maintainable styles.
- **Storybook**: Utilized for rapid component development and review.

## Why Sass and @mui/base?

In the development of BloomHub, the choice of using Sass and the `@mui/base` variant over other styling solutions, such as Emotion, was made to achieve a balance between maintainability, performance, and design consistency.

**Sass** offers a powerful and flexible way to structure and manage styles. With its features like variables, nesting, and mixins, Sass promotes organized and reusable styling code, making it easier to maintain a consistent design throughout the project.

**@mui/base** is a versatile and customizable variant of Material-UI. It allows us to utilize Material-UI's design components while enabling fine-grained control over styling. This choice aligns with the project's goal of building a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.

While Emotion is a popular CSS-in-JS library, in this project, we opted for Sass and the `@mui/base` variant to leverage the familiarity of traditional CSS syntax, maintain separation between styles and logic, and enable easier collaboration among team members.

By using Sass and `@mui/base`, we aim to strike a balance between design flexibility, maintainability, and performance, ensuring a robust and efficient development experience.

## Storybook Component Review

To ensure the consistency and functionality of the components, Storybook was used to create a comprehensive documentation system. This allows quick visual and interactive review of individual components, their various props, and possible states. It enhances the development process by facilitating component testing and collaboration.
